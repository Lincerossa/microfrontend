pro

1. Engeenering team could use different technologies completely indipendently
2. Each of them can develop their product with their own technologies
3. So microfrontend are where we take a monolithic application and we divide it into multiple smaller applications,
4. isolation and less breaking possibilities
5. easy  to setup



cons:

1. container has to be re-deployed every time a npm module is updated
